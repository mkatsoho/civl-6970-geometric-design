# C06 cross section design


## objectives
- To Understand the Cross Section, Elements: Lane, Median, Shoulder; and
- To Determine number of Lanes for Freeway Design

## cross section elements
- principal elements:
    - travel lanes
    - shoulders
    - medians
- marginal elements:
    - curbs
    - gutter
    - guardrails
    - sidewalks
    - roadside barriers
    - side slopes

## AASHTO minimum lane width (feet)
- freeways 12
- rural arterials 11
- urban arterials 10
...
- Residential 9

## AASHTO minimum Shoulder width (right, median)
- freeways >=6 lanes (10, 10)
- freeways 4 lanes (10, 4)

- Rural Arterial ADT > 2000 (8, -)
- Rural Arterial ADT 400 - 2000 (6, -)
...
- Urban Arterial high type (10, -)
- Urban Arterial low type (2, -)
...
- rural & urban collectors, ADT > 2000 (8, -)
- rural & urban collectors, ADT 1500 - 2000 (6, -)

## functions of a median:
- Providing a recovery area for out-of-control vehicles
- Separating opposing traffic
- Providing stopping areas during emergencies
- Providing storage areas for left-turning and U-turning vehicles
- Providing refuge for pedestrians
- Reducing the effect of headlight glare
- Providing temporary lanes and cross-over during maintenance operations

## median types
- raised 
- flushed
- depressed

### raised median
- frequently used in urban arterial streets because they facilitate the control of left-turn traffic at intersections by using part of the median width for left-turn only lanes
- Disadvantages include possible loss of control of the vehicle by driver if median is accidentally struck, and casting of a shadow from oncoming headlights which results is driver not being able to see the curb


### flushed median
- commonly used on urban arterials
- They can also be used on freeways, but with a median barrier
- To facilitate drainage of surface water, the flushed median should be crowned

### depressed median
- Generally used on freeways and rural multi-lane highways
- Very effective in draining surface water
- Side slopes of 6:1 are used on freeways

## media opening
- full median opening
- directional median opening

## concrete sidewalks
- Sidewalks are usually provided on roads in urban areas, but very seldom are they
provided in rural areas.
- However, the provision of sidewalks in rural areas should be evaluated during
the planning process to determine if any sections of the road require them.
- For example, rural high-speed highways may require sidewalks at areas with
high pedestrian concentrations, such as areas adjacent to schools, industrial plants, and local businesses. Generally, sidewalks should be provided when pedestrian traffic is high along main or high-speed roads in either rural or urban areas.
- When no shoulders are provided on arterials, sidewalks are necessary even when
pedestrian traffic is low.
- In urban areas, side walks should also be provided along both sides of collector
streets that serve as pedestrian.

## pedestrians

### Reducing Pedestrian-Vehicular Conflicts
- eliminate left and/or right turns,
- prohibit free-flow right-turn movements,
- prohibit right turn on red,
- convert from two-way to one- way street operation,
- provide separate signal phases for pedestrians,
- eliminate selected crosswalks, and
- provide for pedestrian grade separations


## Concrete Sidewalks
- Construction of sidewalks on both sides of the street would not be required in such cases as when the roadway parallels a railroad or drainage canal and pedestrians would not be expected.
- If sidewalks are constructed on the approaches to bridges, they should be continued across the structure.
- If continuous sidewalks are constructed on only one side of the street, pedestrians should be provided access to transit facilities located on the opposite side of the street.
- Grades on sidewalks should not exceed 5% when not adjacent to a
travel way.

## determine # of lane on freeway design

### basic freeway segment capacity

- Term freeway capacity
    - the maximum sustained 15-min flow rate, expressed in passenger cars per hour per lane, 
    - that can be accommodated by a uniform freeway segment under prevailing traffic and roadway conditions in one direction of flow.

- Term Free-flow speed (FFS)
    – the mean speed of passenger cars that can be accommodated under low to moderate flow rates on a uniform freeway segment under prevailing roadway and traffic conditions.
- ideal freeway
	- 12-foot lanes
	- Paved right shoulder  6 feet
	- Passenger cars only
	- Interchange spacing  2 miles
	- Level terrain, grades < 2%
	- Driver population dominated by regular/familiar users

- HCM LOS, density to predict Level of Service
	- LOS A, Max Density=11 pc/mi/ln
	- LOS B, Max Density=18 pc/mi/ln
	- LOS C, Max Density=26 pc/mi/ln
	- LOS D, Max Density=35 pc/mi/ln
	- LOS E, Max Density=45 pc/mi/ln
	- LOS F, >45 pc/mi/ln

- factors affecting free flow speed
    - Lane Width and Lateral Clearance
    - Number of Lanes
    - Interchange Density
    - other factors
        - passenger car equivalents
        - driver experience

- Operational Analysis Procedure Inputs
	- Lane Width
	- Lateral Clearance
	- Interchange Density
	- Specific Grade or General Terrain
	- Base FFS and FFS
	- Peak-Hour Factor
	- Heavy Vehicles (Trucks and RVs)
	- Driver Population

- Operational Analysis General Idea
    - Find free flow speed
    - Find passenger car volume per lane, peak 15 minutes
    - Find estimated speed
    - Calculate density
    - Determine LOS
