# C07 intersection design

## objective

- types of intersections
- key design consideration
- key design elements
- ISD
- turning roadways, auxiliary lanes and median openings
- indirect turns and unconventional intersections
- roundabouts



## contents

- intersection types
    - at-grade intersections (3/4/multi-legs/circular)
    - grade separations without access
    - grade separations with access ramps (interchanges)


- at-grade intersections: key characteristics
    - physical area vs. functional area
    - management of conflicting movements
    - traffic control / capacity
    - design objectives


- physical area (small) vs. functional area (big)

- functional area includes
    - queue storage
    - maneuvering distance
    - perception-reaction distance

- conflict points
    - diverging
    - merging
    - crossing

- traffic control
- the type of traffic control affects:
    - user movements
    - conflict points
    - delay
    - capacity

- design objectives for intersection design in Green Book
    - human factors => 
    - traffic considerations =>
    - physical elements => 
    - economic factors => 

- intersections: key design elements
- 

- ISD cases (A to F)
    - no control
    - stop control on the minor road
    - yield control on the minor road
    - traffic signal control
    - all-way stop control
    - left turn from the major road


- Case A, intersection with no control
    - assumes drivers reduce speed to 50% of design speed
    - prefer appropriate SSD on both approaches

????


- Auxiliary lanes, consider:
    - operating speed (the 85th percentile speed)
    - volumes (approaching and opposing)
    - proportion of turning traffic

- channelizing islands using pavement markings or raised islands
    - can server as a pedestrian refuge

- island design
    - urban intersection: 50ft^2, prefer 100ft^2
    - rural intersections: 75ft^2, prefer 100ft^2

- Turning roadways: 3 cases (provision for passing a stalled vehicle)
    - Case I: One-lane, one-way operation with no provision for passing a stalled vehicle
    - Case II: One-lane, one-way operation with a provision for passing a stalled vehicle
    - Case III: Two-lane operation, either one-way or two-way

- median openings / left turn
    - positive offset to avoid obscuring of sight distance
    - avoid negative offset, tapered instead of parallel to avoid obscuring of sight distance

- median openings: geo design key consideratnion
    - selection of design vehicle to be accommodated
    - selection of median-end treatment: bullet nose: allows for large turning radii and vehicle off-tracking
    - width of median on major roadway

- indirect turn
    - cons: increase the travel time 
    - pros: increase operation efficiency by eliminating signal phases
    - pros: increases safty by reducing conflict points or relocating to some of lower volume intersections


- RCUT
    RCUT: Restricted Crossing U-turn
    RCUT: reduced conflict U-turn

- Jughandle left turn
- displaced left turn (aka. CFI continuous flow intersections)
- Median U-turn crossover
- J-turn (use raised median, prohibit cross traffic)
