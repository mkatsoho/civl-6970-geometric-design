# C07a-interchange design


## objectives
- Interchange Definition
- Interchange Warrants
- Interchange Types
- Determination of Interchange Configurations
- Spacing Between Interchanges
- Interchange Geometric Layout

## definition - interchange
AASHTO: 

“a system of interconnecting roadways in conjunction
with one or more grade separations that provides for
the movement of traffic between two or more
roadways or highways on different levels”

## two categories
- system interchange
    - Freeway to other freeway
    -  Handle large traffic volume at high speed
    - Minimize weaving sections due to high volume
- service interchange
    - Freeways to lesser facilities
    -  Handle lower traffic volumes at lower speed
    -  Optimize freeway ramp movements at the crossroad

## interchange warrants
    - Design Designation
    - Elimination of Bottlenecks or Spot Congestion
    - Elimination of a Hazard/Risk
    - site topography
    - road user benefits
    - traffic volume

## interchange types
    - Diamond
    - Single-Point Urban Interchange (SPUI)
    - Trumpet
    - Full Cloverleaf
    - Partial Cloverleaf
    - Directional

## interchange types, pros and cons

## summary of interchange char

by ROW, capacity, cost, and etc

Ranking for ROW, Capacity, and Cost, and Safety

## interchange type proportion

- proportion for service
- proportion for system

## determine a interchange configuration
- System vs. service interchange.
- Urban vs. rural area.
- Number of legs.
- Route continuity, if practical.
- Uniformity of exit and entrance patterns, if practical.
- Traffic conditions: exiting/entering volume to/from the mainline, through and turning volumes on the minor road, acceptable amount of delay/LOS for each movement, and need for/type of traffic control on minor road (uninterrupted flow, signal or stop sign).
- Operational characteristics: single or double, exits/entrances, weaving and signing.
- lane balance and lane continuity.
- Road user impacts: travel distance and time, safety, convenience and comfort.
- Number of pedestrians crossing the minor road.
- Presence of an attached frontage road.
- Importance of minor road signal coordination.
- Right of way impacts and availability.
- Environmental impacts.
- Cost of construction.
- Cost of maintenance.
- Feasibility of stage construction.
- Maintenance of traffic for reconstructed interchanges.

## spacing btw interchanges
- rural
    - commonly btn 5 to 10 miles
    - minimum is 2 mines
- urban
    - minimum desirable is 1 mile
    - closer spacing? consider collector-distributor roads (weaing > 1K v/h/l)

## terms
